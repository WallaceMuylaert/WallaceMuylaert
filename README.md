### About Me 👋

Hello! I'm a passionate developer who loves building smart solutions using technology. I work mainly with Django (Python) and Node.js (JavaScript/TypeScript), and I have experience creating everything from powerful bots to self-service flows and complete web applications.

My projects usually focus on:
- ✨ Automation (bots, flows, task schedulers)
- 📊 Visual and interactive interfaces (dynamic UIs)
- 🧬 Data analysis, machine learning applications, and business tools
- 🚀 Integration of modern frontend technologies with solid backend logic

I'm always looking for ways to make technology more accessible, even for those who aren't tech-savvy.

### Current Focus 🔍
- Applying machine learning to improve business processes and decision-making
- Creating tech services for companies of all sizes

### Tech Stack 🔧
- Django / Python
- Node.js / JavaScript / TypeScript
- React / Frontend Libraries
- PostgreSQL / Sequelize
- Machine Learning (scikit-learn, TensorFlow basics)
